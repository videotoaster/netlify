<strong>VideoToaster's bots</strong> are usually experiments within the scope
of social media websites. These experiments do not use or engage with user data
outside of tweets and other postings made publicly available by users on Twitter,
Discord, or other websites. VideoToaster does not care what you do with the bots
as long as the context of operation is safe-for-work, meaning no explicit violence,
pornography, or other unsavory content is allowed to be used with the projects.
The bots also require that you <strong>DO NOT</strong> use them to flame, harass,
or otherwise harm users.<br><br>
Other than that, the bots are free to use however you like. :)
