  <strong>VideoToaster's bots</strong> do not request, store, or read, any user data outside
  of what the user wishes to be public data. Only public tweets, handles, usernames, and
  profile pictures are within the scope of the data that the bot needs to operate. Any
  other data is either never read or immediately discarded.
