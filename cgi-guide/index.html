  <blockquote><i><b>Warning!</b> <a href="https://bcow.xyz">A buncha nerds whose opinions shouldn't matter to you</a> will
  tell you that CGI binaries are an "outdated" standard. However, PHP still runs a good chunk of the internet. So they can
  take their stupid clown-ass opinions and shove them up their ugly, swampy asses.</i></blockquote>
