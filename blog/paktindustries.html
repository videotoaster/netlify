  <p>I'm not gonna lie, when 3 people were using this thing it felt cramped. Now there's 8.<br>
     I had to get used to the multi-user system lifestyle. You see, it used to be just me and <a href="https://warsawpakt.xyz">Pakt</a>
     himself. Then things changed and <a href="//catvibers.me">DanK</a> got invited - after DigitalOcean randomly booted us for reasons
     unknown. We got used to the comfiness of the 20GB of RAM and 1.2 TB of storage when it was just the three of us. And then, something
     weird happened. Something most of us probably expected... DanK invited another user on.</p>
  <p>This user was <a href="//aa.catvibers.me">AAGaming</a>. I hated this guy at first. He was really annoying (to me, at least) until I
     really spent a bit around him. He's a good friend of mine now. Then Pakt decided it shouldn't just be us anymore. Some dumbass invited
     Mugman, whom I shall not link here, because I don't think he has a site. Also, he kinda blew me off when I got onto him for installing
     something he shouldn't have on the VPS. Anyways, it was 5 people now. Then Mr. Pakt opened the floodgates when he made something cool...
     <a href="//industries.warsawpakt.xyz">the Pakt Industries site.</a></p>
  <p>This may have been a bad idea. Only time will tell. He made a registration page. I used it to remake my account after the VPS switched
     to Ubuntu (and I lost my entire site yet again). This let users "apply" for an account on the VPS (it's more of a direct registration).
     This meant that more people could use the VPS - but you'd have to restart <code>sshd</code> to get the VPS to allow SSH. I don't personally
     use SSH, because I don't have access to a decent client, or keys, but the VPS does have TTYD installed. It'd ruin the vetting process
     if I told you where, though.</p>
